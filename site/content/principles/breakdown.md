### Fear of breakdown: enactments

The fear comes from an experience that happened but it's not in memory.

Things that happen early in life may not be registered on our normal memory systems. Also some extreme experiences, may be not registered in memory for their traumatic implications.

So we can fear something we don't have a symbolic representation for.

Winnicott said it's better to create the conditions for a healthy breakdown, so it can be in memory and addressed, avoiding a life lived in fear.

This relates with the “enactment” in therapy. It's the idea that we need to repeat to remember to elaborate. Some things need to come into actions for our minds to have a chance to deal with them.

Therapist who use enactment need to be really aware of them and know how to manage processes as they evolve inside the relationship. Usually a therapist finds themself in the middle of an enactment, where they are playing a traumatising role for the client. Being able to recognise and repair is the only healthy way through.

I see this as unconscious entanglement, where our conflicts somehow sync and we find ourselves playing a part we could not even imagine.

The only way to understand this is to be in the middle…so don't beat yourself…

It was Ferenczi who first recognised this pattern (”confusion of tongues”). But Freud had already written a paper called “repeat, remember, and working through”.
