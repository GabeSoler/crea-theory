### A theory for everything: bio-logic

There is a simple model that helps me to understand multiple phenomenon, from mind, to biology, groups, sociology, ecology, economics.

It's simple, and for the same reason useful.

- First there is creative chaos from where some functional element emerge
- Then those come together and create a border, defining an identity
- The identity assembles to a territory of safety, feeding, playing, learning and relating.
- Then there are others doing the same, and we create synergy.
- Synergy creates meta organisations and new emergencies.
- Each identity has a few tendencies:
- Homeostasis and feedback to keep balance.
- Feedforward, line of flight, we move to avoid problems or to get rewarded.
- Growth: new tendencies emerge from inside the system, making it more complex.
- Growth creates instability and may be mistaken with an external attack, losing the chance of reaching a higher order balance.
- Feedforward towards growth, it's a period of fast learning and change to reach a new homeostasis, it's important to find balance again for the identity to not shatter.
