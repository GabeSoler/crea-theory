This idea is that our minds are made of some sort of a crochet pattern. Each knot combines different parts of ourselves, mind, body and affect. Lacan: real, symbolic, imaginary.

When the pattern it's broken, unconscious forces move in disruptive ways.

Therapist by connecting parts and making sense create new knots that strength the network.
