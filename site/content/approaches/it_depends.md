### Nor this nor that or why “it depends”

A nor this nor that position is not always easy to understand or handle.

For me it comes from a simple truth of living systems, we need a right amount of things, we need just enough.

How much is too hot at home? Probably above 23 degrees Celsius. How much is too cold? Probably bellow 18. Do hot or cold are the right answer?

I say nor this nor that.

Just enough, somewhere between. And… it depends on the person, the clothes, etc.

That's why a good therapist always says “it depends”
