# The intra-grative path

- A four axis path
    
    This image bellow represents the idea that we can go towards stress states to the left and meditative states to the right.
    
    The horizontal movement is the becoming path, embracing multiplicity.
    
    From bottom to top we grow in abstraction, steps of morals and understanding. This is the development path.

    Therapists usually master the stress states while monks and shamans the meditative ones.

Inside these axis one can specialise and manage more one area.

There could be many ways inside these map, many specialisations. Warriors also master their stress responses to be able to fight. Explorers may move between, shamanes too.

üí° As explored in my thesis, professions carry a transitional function. They are *between* at their core, even thought they can get perverted by abuse and external control. At the core of each profession there is a point of assemblage between intensive and extensive and a transitional plane of ‚Äúobject use‚Äù, of technique that carries the intentions of the person and the archetypical force of the tradition. Every progression*/profession* can be transitional and benefit from these reflections(here applied to psychotherapy)
