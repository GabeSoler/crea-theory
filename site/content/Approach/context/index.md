## Approaches

This is a more abstract level to understand our practice. It deals with our assumptions about reality itself. Our assumptions about what is learning, what is change, what is the best way to find new knowledge.

Therapy traditions have different approaches. Sometimes there are parts of traditions that are closer to other traditions, at this level.

This means that a relational psychoanalyst may be closer to a relational person centre therapists, than a positivistic psychoanalyst and a positivistic person centred therapist. Because this shapes deeper values than the discursive elements of the tradition.

## Second generation: two points of view

- Second generation
    
    Here there is still a divide between subjective and objective but the theories acknowledge each other. So they do not negate each other, like post positivism acknowledge of a subjective bias, but the project is the same.
    
    Socio-constructivist deals with systems and how they shape realty, shifting the discussion into practices and instruments creating reality.
    
    Hermeneutics introduce interpretation, discussions, co-construction.

- Relational
    
    A new set of practices have emerged that put an empasys in the relationship and what emerges between people. Some trace their roots to Ferenci, one of the closest to Freud. Some to Winnicott with the idea of the good enough mother. Some base it in the systemic ideas, going back to Bateson. Some in the projective identification, and the internal ‘relational’objects.

- Narrative
    
    Following the narrative turn in social sciences, there is a new therapy dedicated to narrative. 
    
    This turn mean that there was a consensus that the main role of humanities and social research was to create narratives. The idea of a symbolic interactionism, as the basis of human organisation and mind formation permeated many fields. 
    
    This allowed scholars to start to write more freely, using narrative style and letting behind the dry third person writing of science.

- Cybernetic
    
    Cybernetic approaches are a bit different in the sense that are based in complex logical structures, that gave birth to computers. The theories themselves where not attached to mechanical machines, and gave birth to other research projects. Context, loops, sets, are part of a different perspective for life, society and therapy.

## Fourth generation: beyond and between

- In-between
    
    This group starts diluting many categories and making new logical structure, many incorporate the cybernetic logic but with new spins. There is a new phenomenology that includes body, movement and relationship.
    
    Varela is crucial in many of this, as creator of autopoiesis and  neurophenomenology.
    
    Developmental approaches also emerge as a form of analysis, crossing through traditions. The human as process in stages, reality in nested structures is a distinct new approach.
    
    Each new component is different than previous once,
    
    Participatory incorporated all this new elements in a coherent new approach, but I thought it was better to show the new components
    
    - Phenomenology -third Gen
        
        Phenomenology of Husserl was trying to be objective inside subjectivity. It also was disembodied. Merlou Ponty changed this, incorporating new depths to phenomenology.
        
        After that turn, we see further incorporation of elements, with enactments and relationship.

- Integrative
    
    In general, use of abstract meta theorisation to organise knowledge. I differentiate because of the abstract quality of it, and the rigidity of those categories.
    
    - Integration(comment)
        
        When we do integration it can be at any level of the therapy stack. We can integrate at the components level and it's technique, at a approach level, at a tradition level.
        
        Opazo integration is mostly at the components/technique level, with it's own approach level.
        
        Wilber integration is at the approach level, with a meta approach.
        
        Participatory approach is an in-between approach, and therefore somehow integrative.
        
        There is integration at tradition level, teaching person centre, psychodynamic and CBT, without clarifying the other levels (not coherent).
        
        Jung's integration happens at the person level, addressing the person of the therapist, what I call intra-grative, or alchemical integration.

## Fifth generation: (non) approach

- Transitional (non) approach
    
    After seeing the full stack of therapy, the question is how to proceed. My answer is to focus on the person of the therapist and allow development to take course. This course is aided by a good menu of options that are not competing.
    
    Instead of offering truth to swallow create an environment where new therapist can develop their own truths. Using developmental research we  clean the path for it to thrive.
