Third generation: multi perspectives 

## postmodern

# Deconstruction

After structuralism comes the deconstruction 

No model of the world can represent the word 

Models are paradoxical in themselves, you need to just digg a bit deeper

# Genealogy

What we think and our practices can be examined as historical constructions

Society shapes reality, excluding the people who do not fit with the word view

Close to socio-constructionist, but in a postmodern way. Things can be challenged, systems are absurd, the structure does not hold. 

There are new lines all the time emerging that are forgotten


- Relational
    
    A new set of practices have emerged that put an empasys in the relationship and what emerges between people. Some trace their roots to Ferenci, one of the closest to Freud. Some to Winnicott with the idea of the good enough mother. Some base it in the systemic ideas, going back to Bateson. Some in the projective identification, and the internal ‘relational’objects.

    # relational psychoanalysis

Based in the ideas of Ferenci, they propose we need to allow enactments to happen. Unconcious sincronize and in that way we can go deeper. 

All is relational and subjectivity is another relationship.

Uses a contextual phenomenology, with an awareness of the relaitonal aspect.

# intersubjective psychoanalysis

With a base in Winnicotts idea of the mother, this approach does not focuss fully in the relational, but also in the unique identity of the therapist and client. 

It proposes to move between a realational field and a subjective awareness. 

One in the third and third in the one

one in the third is the idea of fusion between people. We became one in the emergence of two.

Third in the one is the capacity to keep a third position even with someone else, keeping a reflective instance and your own identity. For Winnicott the mother needs to appear as someone by itself, intrudicing small frustrations that lead to development.


# Analytic third

Based in the work of Tomas Ogden, he proposes there is an emergent unconscious between analyst and client. 

In this position there is a possibility of dreaming the dreams of others, and help in this way with conflicts over our heads.

Based in the containment of Bion (object relations), we can hold chaotic objects of our clients through pojective identification.


- Narrative
    
    Following the narrative turn in social sciences, there is a new therapy dedicated to narrative. 
    
    This turn mean that there was a consensus that the main role of humanities and social research was to create narratives. The idea of a symbolic interactionism, as the basis of human organisation and mind formation permeated many fields. 
    
    This allowed scholars to start to write more freely, using narrative style and letting behind the dry third person writing of science.

    # Narrative Therapy

This therapy uses narrative as its frame of reference. 

Sometimes associated with pragmatism, or systemic, I think it has its own space. 

It can be linked to the genealogy of Foucault, as it explores how we create our realities through telling stories, but we also forget, and edit this story. Through exploring this more deeply we can realise we can narrate ourselves differently. Sometimes we have forgotten many relationships, areas, traits or ourselves and by including them in our narrative we can start changing.


- Cybernetic
    
    Cybernetic approaches are a bit different in the sense that are based in complex logical structures, that gave birth to computers. The theories themselves where not attached to mechanical machines, and gave birth to other research projects. Context, loops, sets, are part of a different perspective for life, society and therapy.

    # Autopoietic-individual

Ontologic therapy was created following the work of Humberto Maturana, who created the concept autopoiesis.

The idea is to use our conversations to create realities in the living-together.

Going deeper into our biology, our capacity to coordinate with each other, our emotional landscape.

It is part of the cybernetic/systemic group in its way of thinking.

# Systemic

Following the systemic way of thinking, that says the whole is more than the sum of the parts, we start studying organisations of entities. 

In therapy it took shape into family therapy and other types of individual therapy that paid attention of the context and organisations of problems. Instead of seeing a symptom as a thing in itself, they see how it is placed within a network of relationships and practices.

# Autopoietic-social

Following the work of Maturana and Varela, Luman developed a theory of society using the concept autopoiesis. 

Each part of society can be understood as self reproducing systems, with their own codes and flows of information, trying to preserve themselves and differentiate from others.

Even though not necessary applied to therapy it can inform systemic thinking and give perspective about how things are set up in a broader scale.
