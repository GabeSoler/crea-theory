- Second generation
    
    Here there is still a divide between subjective and objective but the theories acknowledge each other. So they do not negate each other, like post positivism acknowledge of a subjective bias, but the project is the same.
    
    Socio-constructivist deals with systems and how they shape realty, shifting the discussion into practices and instruments creating reality.
    
    Hermeneutics introduce interpretation, discussions, co-construction.
    
    # Post-positivistic

You can find evidence based on any of both positivisms, but this days most will be here.

There is not a naive reality but a complex one that needs constant questioning.


# Socio-constructionist

Society and it's structure shapes multiple realities.

Social classes and oppression are shaping what we see.

Community psychology more than therapy.

Structuralism

# Psychoanalysis: Lacan

Lacan saw the unconscious as a structure to study 

He made maps of the unconscious

Symbols and their meaning sometimes move apart of each other and the analysts need to find the connection 

Need for s cut to tie the unconscious. Thought needs to be stopped.

Three main structures, psychotic, perverse and neurotic

Psychotic: does not have a law, rules, moral 

Perverse: understand it but rejects it

Neurotic: accepts it and lives with it

# Symbols: Jung

The unconscious has a structure to unveil. Archetypes and mythems allow us to understand those pieces 

Analysts can interpret and discover the secrets behind

Close to the hermeneutics tradition and to structuralism, in the sense that there is a clear meaning behind

# functionalism

# Object relations: Klein +

Here we start seeing the idea of human connection, as we create objects of relationships.

At the begging there is a centre on fantasy, and unconscious communication.

It inspired new ways like 

Winnicott

Bowlby

Bion

Kernberg

All of them creating new versions of psychoanalysis


# existentialism

# Humanism

A positive view of humanity looking for their potential.

Growth, expanded Awareness, a new loving world.

Strong in the hippie movement

# Angst

Sometimes associated with humanism and existentialism.

Angst becomes a drive for change.

Heidegger, Sartre, Camus

# Dasein

Mentioned in the angst group, it has its own relevance.

A world comes at hand, our self it's out there 

Death as the only possibility always in front of us moves to change.

Thrown to the world, we need to find ourselves again

We see a world to use, we see tools and other entities also open to death


# Hermeneutic

Following Heidegger, Gadamer develops a philosophy of dialogue.

The world we create has an horizon of meaning, as we move forward this opens up a bit more.

Dialogue allow us to expand our horizon

Distinguished different types of conversation, some utilitarian and others of proper encounter

Crucial for any talking therapy


# Procesal model: Gendlin

Following a mix of phenomenology and existentialism, Gendlin creates a new way of seeing the practice.

Experiencing and naming experience is what moves our “direct reference”
