- In-between
    
    This group starts diluting many categories and making new logical structure, many incorporate the cybernetic logic but with new spins. There is a new phenomenology that includes body, movement and relationship.
    
    Varela is crucial in many of this, as creator of autopoiesis and  neurophenomenology.
    
    Developmental approaches also emerge as a form of analysis, crossing through traditions. The human as process in stages, reality in nested structures is a distinct new approach.
    
    Each new component is different than previous once,
    
    Participatory incorporated all this new elements in a coherent new approach, but I thought it was better to show the new components
    
    - Phenomenology -third Gen
        
        Phenomenology of Husserl was trying to be objective inside subjectivity. It also was disembodied. Merlou Ponty changed this, incorporating new depths to phenomenology.
        
        After that turn, we see further incorporation of elements, with enactments and relationship.

    ## development

    # Deleuze and guattari

Their work is so unique that cannot be fully pinpointed

Mixing cybernetics with Lacan, moving from biology go machines, to social madness.

The borders between disciplines seem to not exist in their work together, while preserving deep and rich analysis

## participatory 


# integrative

In general, use of abstract meta theorisation to organise knowledge. I differentiate because of the abstract quality of it, and the rigidity of those categories.

- Integration(comment)
    
    When we do integration it can be at any level of the therapy stack. We can integrate at the components level and it's technique, at a approach level, at a tradition level.
    
    Opazo integration is mostly at the components/technique level, with it's own approach level.
    
    Wilber integration is at the approach level, with a meta approach.
    
    Participatory approach is an in-between approach, and therefore somehow integrative.
    
    There is integration at tradition level, teaching person centre, psychodynamic and CBT, without clarifying the other levels (not coherent).
    
    Jung's integration happens at the person level, addressing the person of the therapist, what I call intra-grative, or alchemical integration.
