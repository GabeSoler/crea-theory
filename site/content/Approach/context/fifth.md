## Fifth generation: (non) approach

- Transitional (non) approach
    
    After seeing the full stack of therapy, the question is how to proceed. My answer is to focus on the person of the therapist and allow development to take course. This course is aided by a good menu of options that are not competing.
    
    Instead of offering truth to swallow create an environment where new therapist can develop their own truths. Using developmental research we  clean the path for it to thrive.

    # Crea-therapy

Growth 

- Espontaneity(non planned action, coherent and whole≠ Impulsive, planned action, ritual)
- Creativity (relaxed, non directive)
- Curiosity (non forced tendency towards understanding)
- Connection (recíprocal, secure attachment, tendency towards deepening inter and intra actions.)
- Compassion (as willing or intension to be close to suffering, ≠ Love feelings, please, submission)
- Awareness

Stagnation 

- Anger (as fight response. Different to rational indignation or boundary setting).
- Desire (as impulse towards. Different to intension, as abstract tendency)
- Memory(as non-creative object. Creative memory, spontaneous memory are growth inducing)
- Concept (different than conception (Bion)). Concept is stagnated knowledge, untouchable truth. Conceptions are flexible, creative knowledge.
