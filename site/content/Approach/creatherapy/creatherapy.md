# From Psychotherapy to CreaTherapy.
## What is psychotherapy?
It is a hard question to ask, as there are thousands of approaches to help others to feel better. It is usually a relationship, short or long, where one person helps another to face a problem. 
Psycho-therapy is a therapy of the ‘psyche’, a name we gave to what before was called soul, that then was referred as mind. In this case, the definition of psyche varies from school to school, some referring to a more soul, dreamlike space, some to a more rational one.
The second part of the name, therapy, we use for varied topics, from chemical therapy (chemotherapy), physio therapy, music therapy, sound therapy, etc.
Even inside the psychotherapy field, we find people who work with the body, and even the body in different ways. Some will be targeting muscles and tendons, some sensations, some movements, some positions, etc. 
We find some traditions as well that work with groups, doing theatre, doing family dynamics work, doing constellations. Some work with couples, some work with a relational view of the dyad therapist-client. 
Some authors have worked with philosophy, some with cybernetics. Some authors put a higher emphasis in biology, some in rationality, some in human connection.
As I name all this options, I hope you realise that the name, psychotherapy, seems to not be enough to describe the field. The word ‘psycho’ does not describe well the field, as we work with way more things than the mind. 
In my PhD thesis I proposed a new concept “assemblage transformation practices”. I like the name in the context, where I was exploring the idea of reality assemblages, but for a common use it is quite clunky. 
My thesis had a central topic creativity, and after playing with names for a while I (even though talking with my partner, so it betters said we) came up with the idea of CreaTherapy. A concept that aims to open the field, and in a way that is creative from the start.
A common way of addressing this proliferation is integration, but… 

## Why integration is problematic?
A common way forward is to think on integration. So, I will address that idea from the beginning. 
I think it is a great idea. So great that I studied Ken Wilber for years, and I trained in a integrative approach. The problem is: I found many ways of doing integration. 
I had my own way while in my undergrad, something not too complex but that helped me to organise what I was reading. I used Jung idea of the personality and elements, to organise approaches. 
Then I learn Wilber, then Opazo. Then I went to a conference of integrative therapies and listen to about 5 more options. I have found quite a few more. 
But what is the point of integration if we end up with the same problem we started at the beginning: a proliferation of options. 

### But it is that a problem?
That is the thing, it is only a problem from a point of view, but what if, we can promote the creation of infinite models. A space where people can be helped to create their way of working, assuming that it is part of our human condition to be creative and to have a unique perspective? And at the same time, promote spaces of tradition, that can help therapist to feel part of a group with coherent language and values?
Here is where the project crea-therapy.com, as a web app comes to life. Instead of trying to find the right integration, we may better find ways of promoting safe and efficient model creation.
When I was learning multiple models of therapy, by reading some of the pioneers of each approach, I came up with the following question:
What if, what made these therapists great, was not the model they created, but the fact that they created a model?

### Many paths to arrive to the beach.
Once we were walking with my partner to the beach, here close to Dunbar, Scotland. This beach has a peculiar way, where we park and then need to have a 15 minutes’ walk to arrive to the water. Sometimes there is some bog like areas on the way, and there are some paths walked by other people. Some are more pronounced some are fainter.
As we were walking I started to think in a way I quite enjoy, allowing the world to play as a metaphor and help me reach some understanding. 
In a chaotic system there are infinite ways of walking to the beach. But there are some paths that are safer. Not necessary to follow, but already tried.
I hope you can grasp what I am going to with this little reflection: in therapy we tend to have infinite paths to help a client, and some are more transited.
Does it make sense to let the paths to reach infinity?
Well, there are benefits on having some paths, for instance, in that way you don’t step into more nature in a forest.
It was in that moment that writing this came to me as a possibility and a desire. Writing a path that I share, a path that does not aim to be the only one, not even in itself be one, but one that may trace a line in the infinite realm of possibilities. Maybe more than a line, a way of making lines that are still open, but contained in safe spaces.

## Intragration
As an alternative to integration I am proposing a different concept: intragration. The main difference is that instead of using a model, as abstract configuration, the process of intragration means a personal assimilation and accommodation of new knowledge. It does not stop with cognitive coherence, but it continues as personal creation/discovery, and therefore deep understanding of an idea. 
We are going to keep exploring this notion through the text, but I feel it is important to introduce this alternative from the beginning. I will expand and add granularity to these first conceptual notions.  

## The old traditions.
I find the idea of traditions quite fascinating. I can of hate them when they become ‘cult like’ and love them when they become a space for sharing where therapist feel free to express their thoughts and experiences. 
I have the problem that when I read authors inside traditions I find that some of them are closer to other traditions. Sometimes in the granularity of authors, we find that their values and approaches may have diverged from the original quite a lot. 
I do not see that as a problem, as they keep a coherent language and keep feeling part of their tradition. But we usually do not map those divergencies of epistemology or of field of application. 
For instance Donald Winnicott can be read quite easily as an humanistic author, and even with mystical notes every so often. However, he was always a psychoanalytic therapist, even being the president of the professional body. Notions like true self, are quite close to authenticity of person centred. The emphasis in spontaneity, playing, instinctive attunement in Winnicott’s work, seems sometimes quite close to Perl’s Gestalt. 
It is that space, of authors finding new spaces inside the tradition what made me develop a model composed of parts, able to be flexible enough to describe our own process of individuation as a psychotherapist.

With this image I aim to separate things a bit, at the moment of analysing a therapist or a model. The tradition stays important as a coherent community space, however the philosophy, practical theory and practice are in a space between tradition and therapist.
We as therapist can individuate inside the tradition, creating/discovering new areas, incorporating new knowledge, applying things in a slightly more coherent way. 
The area of the person of the therapist becomes the second pilar on the model, which may be using an even bigger space. We as therapist are always in process, we are changing and discovering things. Some ideas apply better for a while and then others make more sense.
We struggle, we try, we have crisis, we need to re-think our practice and sometimes our whole lives in the process. What we learn is not dissociated from who we are, and that makes therapy a strange space, a profession that works different than any other profession, because the personal and the professional are intimately interconnected.
I am not advocating for a full merge, and I think it is healthy to arrive to a work/life balance. But after seeing hundreds of colleagues, and myself learning therapeutic approaches and techniques, I can testify we are always using and changing our life as we learn. We suffer, we question, we have a crisis and that’s how we learn.
Some may be able to hold things apart for a while, but when you start seeing clients, it is your own body, dreams or relational spaces, that tells you at some point: 
this is not what I expected, this goes so far beyond what I was told.

### Goals:
I would like to make explicit the goals of the project I am going to unfold in this text:
•	to be more a template for therapeutic thinking than new tradition,
•	to be compatible with therapeutic traditions of different origins,
•	promote personal creation, by seeing theory as a creative/developmental process, and
•	to create a language for mutual understanding in a space of multiplicity of thinking.
These goals may be more or less covered with the model I am presenting to you, but I think I have arrived to a satisfactory place (that may have still many iterations to come to fully achieve this points).
I aim for it to not compete with the current approaches, but to allow users, being therapist of clients, to understand the field, as if adding a layer of tissue between the current knowledge, so there are lines of communication and understanding.

## The model:
CreaTherapy is composed of three main parts:
-	Philosophy:  a description of notions about reality and knowledge creation
-	Components: areas of knowledge inside psychotherapy that could belong to any tradition
-	Personal/professional profile: concepts to describe a psychotherapist in their own process.
There is a second layer that will need more space at a later stage, which include: 
-	a broad and flexible developmental notion
-	a notion about shadow and shadow work
-	therapeutic principles to guide a process
This second part include more of my own opinions, while the first part tries to give a more overarching view of the field. I have consciously narrated the text with my own voice, however the voice from where this emerged it is quite separate from my own identity, as some sort of abstract template that helps me organise my knowledge. I say this because I feel the abstraction can be used in multiple ways, many of which I may not be conscious about. I love seeing multiple interpretations in a model, and it has happened every time I explain it, as each colleague makes different use of the same concepts (this to say: be free to think in your own way, my way is only one possible example of use of these concepts).
