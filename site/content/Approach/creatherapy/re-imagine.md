# A therapy for the future

Sometimes, I feel we are just dipping our toes in the water, wondering what therapy could be. It is as if we are still in the middle ages of a revolution that may change how we see ourselves and the world around us.

When I try to step forward, I find myself with two contradictory limitations: attempts to make therapy more organised and scientific and attempts to divide it into cult-like microspheres. 

I feel a tension between standardisation and plurality that stagnates my movement. 

So, how can we overcome this paradigmatic tension?

I propose a new language for discussing psychotherapy and, therefore, communicating between approaches. At the same time, I propose a model that encourages personal creation and, thus, fragmentation. We are held by a system that invites us to be diverse.

> I imagine a future where therapy is a creative practice with solid foundations to make it reliable in society and exciting at an individual level.

So, I see this project as a baby step towards something more significant that I still cannot fathom. My main attempt is to break the paradox I find myself in, hoping in this way, something new can emerge.

The project currently has two sides: CreaTherapy and CreaTheory. The first is a progressive web app that functions as a website with dynamic content. The second is where you stand now, a page with essays explaining my new perspective.

CreaTheory is divided into sections:
- Approach: where I reflect on the more abstract areas of the project.
- Profile: where I explain the profile system of CreaTherapy
- Practice: where I reflect on how to apply the ideas
- Growth: where I propose a model of persona/professional growth system

The sections are sometimes divided into groups; if you are in an essay and see <i class="bi bi-layout-sidebar-inset"></i> on the nav, it will show you the group you are in. 

[CreaTherapy](https://crea-therapy.com/) Web App is the other side of the project, and I would like to also give you an overview of it. The site has multiple tools you can only open if you are signed up. I created each to help you navigate a plural space of theory/practice so we do not get lost in the attempt.

The profile system aims to help you map your caring and learning as a process so you can save multiple entries for each and keep an eye on your changes. A personal style and disposition section separates your tradition's teachings from your care assumptions. It offers suggestions for styles and their correlated approaches to give you a field flavour (or an intensities map, as sometimes I think about it). 

I have also created a system to track your progress of knowledge into therapy-relevant areas and a system to track your philosophical assumptions. Both aim to separate knowledge and philosophy from technique and tradition while giving you a map to keep track of your explorations.

This system aims to help ground our creative attempts. I invite you to create and embody your therapy because we only own something when participating in its creation. However, I also appreciate having a community of peers and traditions that maintain coherence and shared values. 

I have added other sections to help you in your journey. 

- A journal space to write about what you learned and an after-session question based on multiple traditions to help you reflect on your practice. 
- A technique space to track the things that work for you. It also includes the option of sharing them with other site users.
- The Diver's space holds prompts for a guided creative process and a shadow entry to reflect on the things you may have left behind in your development.

This set of tools will hold a space only for you to grow and discover and, simultaneously, create a common language and community space so we can still dialogue and grow together.

The project aims to remove unnecessary fences and draw new paths to help delineate the land.
