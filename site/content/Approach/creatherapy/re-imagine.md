# A therapy for the future

Sometimes, I feel we are just dipping our toes in the water, wondering what therapy could be. It is as if we are still in the middle ages of a revolution that may change how we see ourselves and the world around us.

When I try to step forward, I find myself with two contradictory limitations: attempts to make therapy more organised and scientific and attempts to divide it into cult-like microspheres. 

I feel a tension between standardisation and plurality that stagnates and moves forward. 

So, how can we overcome this paradigmatic tension?

I propose a new language for discussing psychotherapy and, therefore, communicating between approaches. At the same time, I propose a model that encourages personal creation and, thus, fragmentation. We are held by a system that invites us to be diverse.

I imagine a future where therapy is a creative practice with solid foundations to make it reliable in society and exciting at an individual level.

So, I see this project as a baby step towards something more significant that I still cannot fathom. My main attempt is to break the paradox I find myself in, hoping in this way, something new can emerge.

The project currently has two sides: CreaTherapy and CreaTheory. The first is a progressive web app that functions as a website with dynamic content. The second is where you stand now, a page with essays explaining my new perspective. 

I would like to explain the role of the CreaTherapy web app and how it relates to the theory. The site has multiple areas you can only open if you are signed up. I thought of each as a tool to help you navigate a plural space of theory/practice so we do not get lost in the attempt.

The profile system aims to help you map your caring and learning as a process so you can save multiple entries for each and keep an eye on your changes. A section for personal style and disposition aims to separate your process from your traditional assumptions of care. It offers suggestions for styles and their correlated approaches to give you a field flavour. 

I have also created a system to track your progress of knowledge into therapy-relevant areas and a system to track your philosophical assumptions. Both aim to separate knowledge and philosophy from technique and tradition while giving you a map to keep track of your departure.

This system aims to help ground our creative attempts. I invite you to create and embody your therapy because we only own something when participating in its creation. However, I also appreciate having a community of peers and traditions that maintain coherence and shared values. 

I have added other sections to help you in your journey. 

- One is a journal space to write about what you learned and an after-session question based on multiple traditions to help you reflect on your practice. 
- A technique space to track the things that work for you. It also includes the option of sharing them with other site users.
- The Diver's space holds prompts for a guided creative process and a shadow entry to reflect on the things you may have left behind in your development.

This set of tools will hold a space only for you to grow and discover and, simultaneously, create a common language and community space so we can still dialogue and grow together.

The project aims to remove fences and draw new paths to help delineate the land.
