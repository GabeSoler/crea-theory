Here, I mention some important components for healthy development. As our mind goes beyond rationality, more practices are needed to manage the higher levels of development, especially spiritual awakening, which demands extra sharpness in the inter- and intra-relationship of all the parts of the self.

Mindfulness and phenomenology help us ground theoretical knowledge in experience. Narrative to create inner coherence. Arts to master more specific movements in our different bodies (gross, subtle, causal, non dual)


- The role of phenomenology: associated with mindfulness and the exploration of the self.
    
    First person: focus on direct perception 
    
    Contextual: focus on how we change while with others 
    
    Embodied: the feelings of the body, felt sense,body movement
    
    Enactive:

- The role of narrative: capacity to articulate a coherent discourse to organise soul/mind/spirit
    
    Linear story 
    
    Emotional arcs
    
    Key moments

- The role of different practices:
    
    Use of expression and play to explore deep layers of self and connections. Also to promote development. Each student should select a few.
    
    - Visuals for imagination (paint, video), active appreciation can increase imagination.
    - Drawing to master the movements of imagination and concepts, skill for manipulation of symbols
    - Poetry to master soul expression, precision of words. Can also make beautiful use of phenomenology and narrative.
    - Novel writing and reading: to imagine plots and character development. World building, imagination, mind coordination.
    - Dancing to master embodiment, master connection with others
    - Singing to master the voice, and inner truth. To master merging with a group, dialogue.
    - Go to master patters, intuition, order, dialogue.
    - Chess to master planning and coordination
    - Instrument to master the connection with objects and the technique of handling and object use.
    - Programming to master abstraction and logic
    - Philosophy to master thinking and world building
    - Games in general target specific skills and interactions.
    - Sports: team work, coordination, group dynamics, strategy, body coordination, body health, trauma process and prevention(breath, end of fight cycles, body discharge)
    - Martial arts can help to train the fight response, body mind coordination and the use of the ki intentionally.



## mystical traditions

The mastery of different states of mind and movements of the ki, can take you to new levels in your therapeutic practice and self development.

I recommend to be cautious as it also can take you with the tradition you are learning with. Mystical traditions usually require commitment and compromise.

My own experience is that there are many inner movements that combine consciousness and ki, and the assemblage point described by Castaneda. All of this involves states beyond the mind/body/soul/spirit integration. In the wrong hands can lead to perversion, expressed by addiction to energies and mental states. These can separate the practitioner from the world and it's responsibilities.

When you go beyond your band of consciousness you can forget your own ethics, your loved ones, your person. I suspect it is possible to achieve a grounded version of this but personally I have not found that as a stable and grounded position (I keep exploring carefully, but I find it risky, and it makes me agree with the secrecy of the old traditions).

Even if I could feel I can be grounded and hold those states I would need years of work with someone to share it, as it has required me constant learning and development. As the self develops strong in world activities, integrating alternated stated without loosing ground becomes possible.

My opinion is that is better to develop using the arts described above and explore the mystical side after having strong bases of personal development, have a strong belonging to a community and master some artâ€™s technique that has taught you how hard work leads to better results.

ðŸ’¡ Be aware that each stage of development has a god-view. Dependant will see god as a good paternal figure, self centred as powerful gods in fight and traditional as a caring master. Modern may see a god mechanic or an architect. Second tier as a complex interconnected system. Third tier as a something between, we are participating to create.

ðŸ’¡ The spiritual is correlated and activated by our transitional work, an I think we can achieve an smooth transition from transitional to spiritual, avoiding master initiations(sometimes imposed and out of timing), spontaneous awareness(may lead to madness), spiritual bypass(avoiding life for the spirit).
