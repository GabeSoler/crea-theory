My definition of health is “a system without distress” (and it apply to all systems). 

Stress has two sides: distress, when it damages the system, and eustress when helps the system to adapt and solve problems.

Humans work stress with the sympathetic and parasympathetic. The main hormones are cortisol and adrenaline at the sympathetic side.

When cortisol is low it is useful, when states for long it start damaging organs and the system in general.

The parasympathetic keep us relaxed but also leads to freeze. The sympathetic activate and also leads to fight/flight. 

The notion of window of tolerance is crucial, a balance of both systems creates a between state of relaxed activation, playfulness, curiosity, creativity.

The extremes can alter any personality, mental state, knowledge. It damages de system at a physical and mental level. And creates symptoms we have called “mental health disorders” and “autoimmune decease”.
