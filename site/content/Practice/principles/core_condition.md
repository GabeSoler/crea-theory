### The one core condition

Rogers proposed the core conditions for therapy, and I agree with them, but they are understood quite differently by different people. 

I have heard so many times trainees saying “Shit I cannot do well the unconditional positive regard”.

Or feeling puzzled by “if I am coherent I would be saying shit in the session”.

For me the one core condition is 

- to keep a psychological contact.

What do I mean with that?

To feel how the me and you are playing, how they make a we, and us, and also two individuals.

Notice when that breaks and see a way to come back to it.

Contact is not push and pull, it's soft touch.

And then be playful, but aware.

The rest comes with practice and self development.
