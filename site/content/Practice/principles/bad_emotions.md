### On good and bad emotions

There are not good and bad emotions, not at least as we usually separate them  between happy or sad.

Good emotions keep us close to realty and bad emotions take us away from reality.

The system that most commonly distort emotions is the stress/fear/fight/adrenaline.

This system can mix with any emotion and move it into an irrational/impulsive space. Happies moves to euphoria, sadness to uncontrolled crying.

Anger can exist without the fight response and help us to put boundaries, and to be assertive. To respect values and stop aggressions.

Soâ€¦ good emotions are calm, without cortisol and adrenaline. But active enough to mobilise, to feel pleasure in the simple practice of craft or deep conversation. They connect us with others and the world and they are appropriate to the context.

It is natural to lose some control of our animal self, and it requires work to tame  and make it our friend.
