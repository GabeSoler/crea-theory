### Development, stress and enlightenment

Something that confuses us often is to see people at different levels of development, enlightenment and disorganisation. 

We have the possibility to move between stages of development, have parts at different levels, or even skills or traits.

On the other hand we can disorganised even if our core is at a high level, and we may carry that level in our conflicts (like being rational but desperate and a bit loosing it).

We can also be enlightened and have a low level of development or have parts at those low levels. We can also move towards disorganized states due trauma or life conflicts.

To help with all this options made this graphic, showing all the movements in different directions.

Structures like borderline is usually placed in dependant and self centred stages, but we can find people at higher development and being fragmented.
