It is important to have a broad notion of unconscious structures because this can be a quick discrimination to see how to work with someone.

These to authors are different. Kernberg is more symptomatic, so we can make sense of a case with what presents in front of us.

Lacan is deeper, and we can have these structures without symptoms. Someone can be fully adapted and deep inside we can see their desire and relationships with the world are perverse or psychotic.

Diagnosis here is crucial because it will shape how you feel in the session and how your technique will impact your client. 

I have heard many therapist blaming themselves for constant failure with a client who is structurally borderline or perverse.


### Lacan

Structure of desire, rules, and objects 

Neurotic: the normal. Accepts rules, sees the world as organised and stable. Respects otherness.

Perverse: understand the rules but does not accept them(fights them). Goes for what they want in a way that does not respect the otherness of the other.

Psychotic: does not understand rules. Does not go for things of the world, pleasure happens inside, it's personal or divine. *Intensive is sufficient for this structure‚Äôs desire, as it's not knotted with the extensive.



### Kernberg

Structure of personality and social reality 

**Neurotic**: reality is stable and socially sanctioned. Can know day and time, reason to be there, good response to schedules.

Identity is coherent, not divided.

Others can have a good and bad side without feeling contradiction.

**Borderline**: reality is messy but somewhat stable. Can confuse the roles and reason to be there.

Identity is messy and sometimes parts emerge out of awareness. 

- This is different to more postmodern self complexity that keeps awareness and coherence with more identities, even if that means to work on it.

Others are good or bad. Or fragmented and contradictory.

- Good and bad here it has to do with connection and construction, versus destructive feelings of anger and jealousy.

**Psychotic**: reality is altered, cannot see roles not understand the situation. May not know day and time, nor where they are in a social way(rules, roles, names of places, etc).

Identity is fragmented, mixing elements without any coherent awareness. Good and bad are mixed (not distinguish between them).

Others are mutating, incoherent, and may change in the same description (‚Äùthis person is good because they gave me food but their face was ugly and then it was monster‚Äù).


### Transitional structuring

I have some conflicts with the neurotic structure as a top limit because there are higher configurations. 

A transitional development can carry components of childhood into objects and games as we keep growing. 

In this way the coherence is found through playing-with, rules are accepted as a game, respect as part of cooperation and competition.

Higher structures can handle components seen as ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù -like engagement with subtle realities-, without losing ground. Negating subtler realities as not real may make someone feel crazy and become crazy. Be aware when you say ‚Äúpsychotic‚Äù.

Even though useful, diagnosis are always dangerous, because sometimes hide subtler differences we are blind to, due our own trauma and development.

I use many techniques that come from child therapy with adults. For many it makes our sessions more engaging and fun. 

Many have parts that are stagnant in childhood because their parents created a controlling, perfectionist, super ego (partnering styles create a part in us that commands how we treat ourselves)

Many with weaker structure feel rejection to the stiffness of ‚Äúadult demands‚Äù and the rigidity of the demant to ‚Äúbehave‚Äù and be ‚Äúgood‚Äù.

So‚Ä¶ for people who is in more fragile structures and for those who have a strong structure that does not let them be happy‚Ä¶ 

And just for everyone‚Ä¶

Be playful üòâ

Let's bring a healthy child towards mature behaviour because it's natural and not because someone wanted to pull the plant for it to grow.

- Just to be clear, natural Human development includes frustration, conflict and pain.
- We need to accept this as part of our nature. This can be a cause for problems or a cause for growth.
- It's also natural to repair, to re connect, to acknowledge responsibility. It is natural but requires some effort.
- So growth looks like: try to be playful, creative, curious, connected and ‚Äúgood‚Äù. Accept when the conflict arises, be responsable of your actions. Repair emotionally and materially.
- Don't hold not use guilt. Don't shame. You, the big You, goes beyond any action and is here to learn and grow. Repair the past, look forward, learn from your mistakes. That is to grow.
- As I say, sometimes doing things right create a crisis. Because when we are feeding well our self, it will want to jump to a next stage. Any development jump means to re structure. So‚Ä¶ a crisis may be a good sign if you read it well.



### On true and false selves

Winnicott developed this diagnosis that put emphasis in the feeling of being true to yourself.

He says there are many configurations of it.

From a lack of a sense of true self

Having a vague feeling of something missing

Looking for it

Having it in areas of life

Having a true self at the centre and a false protecting it.




### On being alone with another

One diagnosis that I find interesting and different is the being alone with another. Winnicott says we need a series steps to achieve this.

I find it relevan as it shows another way to see development and structure, showing us the the emphasis changes our lenses.

So the steps are:

Being

Being alone

Being alone with

Being alone with another

For me is relevant to consider that being is not a pre given. Many develop and are well structured but lack a feeling of being.

That was one of Winnicott s interest, to understand the feeling of falseness and lack of existence.

Being alone with another means that you can relax with other people without losing your centre.

Central for a good therapist and to develop deep and healthy relationships.
