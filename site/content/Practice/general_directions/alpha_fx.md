Concept proposed by Bion, that helps to have a broad view of psychotherapy. 

This general principle says that our unconscious carries two types of elements. Ones are organised, alpha, and the others chaotic, beta.

Beta elements create chaos inside, increasing our death instict and therefore bringing mental health problems to our lives. 

Alpha elements are oranised, they bring stability, creativity, and help us to deal with the world. 

These two elements are the same, in some way. Beta elements need to be organised, they need to be digested by the system, so they can be part of the mental oranisation. 

For this to happen we develop an alpha function, that will transform an element from beta to alpha. We need to develop this function slowly and with the help of others, as with many human things, we do not come with this by default, but with a possibility to develop it. 

When as a therapist we listen and then we give back an impression, or an emotional resonance, or a theory that explains things well. We are showing forms of digesting chaotic experience. We are modeling and helping our clients make sense of the world. Those alpha elements we are co constructing will help our clients to move forward, an also to digest by themselves.
