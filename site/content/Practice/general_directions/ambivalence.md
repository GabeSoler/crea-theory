Clients want to be there and also to run away.

You will feel cooperation and rejection. 

Sometimes expresses in getting ill last minute.

Bringing more or less content to session

Be aware you need to convince the one who is running away. Or challenge it. Sometimes the part who is there is submissive and does not have much influence inside, be aware of a nice submission to therapy.
