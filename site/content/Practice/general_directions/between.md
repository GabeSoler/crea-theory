Therapy happens in a between place. 

Maybe most of the time working from a place of we, of relational connection, empathy, tunning, helps others to regulate and grow.

But this is only a part of the picture. A baby needs more than cuddles. 

Winnicott proposes three main functions for healthy development : holding, handling and object presentation. 

Holding encompasses empathy and emotional tunning. Sometimes actual holding, touch, using a blanket.

Handling enconpasess limits, time, payment, active regulations, exercises.

Object presentation has to do with showing the world, giving things for the client to explore and play with. Concrete objects, ideas and models, exercises, fall in this category.

But there is here another mayor component: the true self of client and therapist. We forget that we have unique needs and unique creative impulses.

Winnicott would say babies first need full adaptation with a slow reveal of the self of the other.

In client work some clients may need that slow appearance. But to not appear as someone means that you tell the client “being yourself is not that important”.

Many therapist are good at it because their coping mechanism and trauma made them good at being compliant and reading emotions to not create conflict. That helps with the holding part, and fails in the next ones.

So, it's important to remember, we work on those four spaces, merged we, contextual it, personal true self (our I Am) and respectful thou, or you, seeing an other as having infinite singularity.
