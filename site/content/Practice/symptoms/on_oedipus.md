The Oedipus relational step it's crucial in personality development. It creates a stop in the unending drive, allowing the person to self regulate and to have ethical reflection.

It needs to happen inside an intense relationship, parent-child or couple, sometimes in deep therapy, when allowing transference and working it well.

The only healthy form is to pause someone in a perverse state. Perverse states are looking for a climax through exiting engagement.

In couples break up this is re-opened, with the potential of a regression. Couples combine adult and child entanglements and if we only end as “adults” there is a child-self that may stay hurt.

Pause: you say this is not the moment but you are not wrong. Preserved the connection, and separates due the nature of a complex world. “I love you but this does not work in this world” keeps the heart connection and establishes a sense of reality simultaneously.

For couples it's “I have loved you, and you are part of my life, I will remember you(not suppress), but it's time to walk apart”.

The non healthy options (from better to worse) are: 

Cutting: splitting without emotion. Clear cut forgetting any human emotional bond. CC is clear and could understand if development is ok. There remains a bitter pain in the heart, UCC feels something is still open.

Breaking: more aggressive, break with anger. UCC is clear but in pain. Cc may be angry and no close.

Detaching: indifference, ghosting. Leaves UCC confused. There is no closure, cc keeps wondering. May damage sense of worth as you are dismissed as a feeling-human.
