Working with true and false selves

Recognise the vulnerable inner child and learn to love-in-pain, instead of avoiding.

Personality and attachment work.


- Types of mask:
    
    inflated: looking big to hide the feeling of small
    
    performer: becoming others trying to find who you are 
    
    dominant: controlling others to not face your wounds
    
    elated: happy and hipomaniac to not face a love break ðŸ’”
    
    ideal-perfect: no mistakes to not feel not-enough 
    
    attractive(always catching an eye): to feel the  love your maternal fx didn't gave you after Oedipus.
    
    attracted(always falling for), to feel meaning after feeling excluded of your belonging. Paternal fx excluded you after Oedipus.
