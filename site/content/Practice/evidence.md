# Evidence and Practice

CreaTherapy aims to be an evidence-based model, albeit not in the conventional sense. I firmly believe in the power of ideas, personal creation, and making things your way. 

How can that connect with evidence?

The simple answer is that proper creation is also a form of discovery. 

And therefore, it is not a whimsical event, of impulse and doing whatever I want. It's a moment where I surprise myself with what I'm creating. Creation transcends the creator, and therefore, it moves us to a new state of self and understanding.

Our minds tend to have blind spots. By development, by upbringing, by ideas that shape our worldview. We all have those blind spots, and that is just part of what it means to have a perspective. 

So, we can always look beyond those constraints, leave a matrix behind and enter a new one.

Creation/discovery is the process by which we break through those restrictions and move into the unknown. So, what is the role of evidence in CreaTherapy?

It can be two things, and I would like to hear what you have to say about the word 'evidence'. 

The most common use is related to trials and double-blind experiments.

So I will ask you to imagine a harsh voice that says, "CreaTherapy is not evidence-based, because it has not gone through the proper research and trials". 

This voice uses evidence to dismiss everything that has not already been tested. But if you see a little bit of history, you can remember how CBT considered meditation an 'esoteric practice' that should not be trusted a few years ago. Now, all primary CBT schools are using meditation. You can see the irony of dismissing everything 'not yet' tested. 

Sometimes we use evidence as a way of cutting through ideas, and that has some uses. The problem is that ideas are cheeky and they always slip around those harsh voices. We have religious scientists, who have relocated their concept of religion to something more abstract, such as viewing God as mathematics or as the creator of emergences in complex systems.

So, CreaTherapy is an idea. It is not based on statistical evidence and does not need to be (although I would love to work on it at some point). However, it is supported by empirical evidence. 

The word "empirical" refers to a position where the basis of our knowledge is grounded in experience. When we apply the idea of empiricism to someone else's experiments, we lose the empirical approach. We replace it with a rationalistic, mathematical version that prioritises statistics over personal experience.

And I am not against that. But sometimes I feel a bit like reading a children's book when I read about why some therapeutic intervention worked or not. 

Why a children's book?

Because I ask a few hundred questions of those numbers. What was happening in those trials, how the manuals were written, who was chosen to try those manuals, who were selected to be the clients, etc. 

In my experience, a good technique can do horrible things, and a pretty poor technique can do wonders. Because in human contexts, our relational spaces, connections, the way we convey information, the way we embody knowledge, the feeling of something being authentic, or that you have experienced it, completely change the client's response. 

I prefer to read about neuroscience. I like it because it is more concrete, and clear what is happening, and the constraints of that can be interpreted from it.  I love the work of Francisco Varela, who developed a methodology called Neurophenomenology, which combines personal experience with neuroscience. 

When I read evidence, I find it interesting. I feel excited and curious, and I think I need to review some of my assumptions. 

It has happened to me with a few concepts in the last twenty years. The idea of the relational space has received strong confirmation in research on attachment, and I was not a centre for my practice before reading multiple books about it. Additionally, the research on Mindfulness in therapy, for which I have written several articles, changed me and many schools, as the evidence was so strong. I studied the idea of development and its associated research, which I find fascinating and beneficial when applied with care. And also, the research into common factors in psychotherapy is intriguing, and it has been found that all approaches seem to have similar results, no matter how (mathematically) evidence-based they are. 

So, evidence. Another way of seeing evidence can be closer to us. When I read about Varela's concept of time, which combines neuroscience and phenomenology, I felt like my mind had expanded, and I saw everything with new eyes for a few days. It was wonderful, magical, exciting, un-grounding and re-grounding. 

That for me is an experience of creation/discovery. Maybe more discovery than creation, but I made those concepts mine, and they changed me, the way I saw, and felt, and thought, and that made me think of so many new ideas and interventions.

The problem is not a dichotomy between evidence and no evidence; the problem is that our own experience, our connection with our clients, our feelings, symbols, and life, are also evidence. And in our line of work, those ways of constructing meaning, in a way that is **meaningful**, matter heavily.

So, the idea of making your own 'little models' has nothing to do with 'leaving the bigger models behind'. 

Also, this is not related to 'your training is not worth it'.

It is more of an invitation to go for it. Go for your training, complete it, and work ethically with a framework that has been tested. Then try things and realise that they are not enough, that there are subtle variations that make it work better. And those have a lot to do with your understanding, embodiment of concepts, and connection with your clientsâ€”a strong entanglement between yourself, your relationality and the theory.

And a good way to start is to pause for a second and wonder, 'Who am I?' 'What do I think is right and wrong?' 'What do I think is real?' 'How do I think I learn best?'

And with those questions, to start exploring and learning. 

The system of profiles is designed to guide you while also opening your view slightly to the side, allowing you to notice that there are more paths, and they are there as possibilities. They are valid and widely used. And there are authors and methodologies of research for them as well. 

Is it the right time for learning them? Maybe not. However, it is reassuring to know that the path has options, that there is not just one way. 

That is why I prefer to work with principles and examples. Because the variations are so significant, sometimes it is more useful to have a guiding hand than a clear path forward.

I believe our profession is advancing based on evidence. Most approaches have adapted to incorporate attachment. Even cognitive behavioural therapy is now using meditation, visualisation, and compassion. We are having randomised trials to use alucinogenics in a safe therapeutic space. And we will continue to mature and evolve. 

But... if there are a few new approaches every year, and the results of most therapies are similar, even with widely different worldviews, maybe we can view it in a kinder, more playful way. 

With care, compassion, and also with wardrails. 

If you're trying to carve your path, know that you may not be the right therapist for everyone. But for many, it may be the best match. 

Recognise that there are challenging processes, regardless of your level of experience. I don't take every client; sometimes I feel that someone else would be the best. Using other services, such as psychiatry, is occasionally necessary. Sometimes you can trust yourself, but also keep an eye on the client and their needs, because that is the centre of the process. Check with them, be empirical, and gather feedback.

I love my supervision, and I think it's a great practice to attend regularly. I also have a few groups of therapists and therapist friends with whom I meet to chat and process. They help me change my ideas periodically and see the limits of what I am thinking.  We all create matrices, and they all have blind spots; it's part of the process. It will continue to happen, regardless of how much you learn.

Trust your senses, trust others, trust research, but make it your own. Be creative in the ways you interpret, use, and understand research. Make space for your principles and ideas, and be coherent and authentic. 

If all at once feels like too much, start small and see who you are in the present, what you think, and what you feel attracted to.

Learn your limits and put your clients first during sessions. Our practice is more rewarding when we are present and when we feel there is something else to discover. It makes working with human suffering a little sweeter.
