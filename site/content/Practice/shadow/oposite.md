# Opposite therapist style

It's the contrary therapeutic position, ie. Playful Vs inquisitive, or compassionate Vs changer.

You need to integrate your opposite in a 80/20 relationship to be balanced, in the sense of keeping your main style while being able to access others in a smaller proportion when needed.

Also the paths have opposites: dreamer Vs explorer, carer Vs sage

# Opposite sexuality

The integration of anima/animus includes an integration of your opposite sexuality and gender. And 80/20 is enough to be balanced, integrating your shadow and keeping your main identity.


# Opposite elements

Following Jung's personality system, that for me is also part of this profiling, we have elements

Fire: intuition

Air: reason

Water: emotion

Earth: sensations

Opposites are fire Vs Earth; water vs air or intuition and sensations, reason and emotion.

We usually have two dominant and the contraires are our shadow.

This can express introverted or extroverted. Air as vocal or as thoutful thinker. Fire as artist in parties and concerts, or as imaginative writer.
