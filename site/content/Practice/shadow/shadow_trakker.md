    # Fawn responses

Common in therapists

Difficult to work around as helps to make client feel comfortable and safe

But it's not really efficient, leaves client feeling a bit confused

Subtle work to heal: involves early trauma, place in the family and a learned position where your true self is not important, focusing on the other in detriment of you.

Many therapist feel they will be good at it because they are good at the fawn response. Pervasive in the profession, specially counselling side.
