- Shadow depth
    - Judging others as shadow projections
    - Self unwanted parts: recognise what's projected
    - ANima animus: soul and spirit, art and technique integration.
    - Antagonist: fighting your transitional enemy. Your shadow and opossit
    - Deep pain: accepting your life pain (deep trauma). Learning to accept mindfully your pain.
    - Deep destructive instinct: soothing your wounded animal mind, soothing your dead instinct. Facing your innate self-destrucci√≥n system.
    - Acceptance of dead: relaxing into mind cessation, accepting your life path, being in peace with your loved ones. Relaxation into the unpredictable
    - Embracing life and dead: living in the present understanding the impermanence and creativity of every moment. Beauty in all there is.
