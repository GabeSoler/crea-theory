# Components
The components aim to bridge the gap between practical theories and practices. It does not achieve its goal fully, and that is a good thing because the idea is that every therapist needs to write a practical theory that is coherent with their views and experiences. 
Again, these are broad groups of theory/practices, pointers to a field of knowledge that can help us know where to look when we need to expand our knowledge.

I have organised these broad groups into five groups of five.
-	Subjective: body, feelings, expression, thoughts, and narrative,
-	Extended Awareness: dreaming and metaphor, Re-programming, subliminal work, sub-parts and selves, and spiritual,
-	Contextual: relational, systems, setup and rewards, transitional objects, and family,
-	Culture: anthropology, arts, politics and power, philosophy, and world-view,
-	Identity: individuation, sex and gender, values, belonging and roles.
 
The groups have this structure behind them.

We can see here that there is a base topic, which, for me, gives weight to the group. It is a personal decision to think about what could be core knowledge. The structure group is the two below, like the group's pillars; they give it body. The top two are somehow more lightweight but more effective as they are closer to a clientâ€™s day-to-day experience.
They are not better than the other, as you can do wonders with any of these. Let's explore the five groups:
