# Components
The components aim to bridge the gap between practical theories and practices. It does not achieve its goal fully, and that is a good thing because the idea is that every therapist needs to write their practical theory that is coherent with their views and experiences. 
Again, these are broad groups of theory/practices, pointers to a field of knowledge that can help us to know where to look when we need to expand what we know.

I have organised these broad groups into five groups of five.
-	Subjective: body, feelings, expression, thoughts, and narrative,
-	Extended Awareness: dreaming and metaphor, Re-programming, subliminal work, sub-parts and selves, and spiritual,
-	Contextual: relational, systems, setup and rewards, transitional objects, and family,
-	Culture: anthropology, arts, politics and power, philosophy, and world-view,
-	Identity: individuation, sex and gender, values, belonging and roles.
 
The groups have this structure behind them.

We can see here that there is a base topic, which for me it is something that gives weight to the group. It is a personal decision thinking about what could be a core knowledge. The structure group are the three bellow which are like the pillars of the group, they give body to it. The top two are somehow more light weight, but more effective as they are closer to a clientâ€™s day to day experience.
I mean that they are not better than the other, as you can do wonders with any of these. Let's explore the five groups:
