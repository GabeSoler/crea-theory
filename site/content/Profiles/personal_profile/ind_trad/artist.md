Feeling everything deeply. Artists express their connection with things and intense places. Artists become more themselves as they feel more.
Risk: The thirst for experience can become an addiction.

Description:The Artist has a self deepening approach, focussing more in their own feelings and experiences, aiming to explore the deepths of the soul.

Shadow:When we polarise into it we may have difficulties with stopping our delightful practices, risking addiction and fixation.

Traditions:Jungian analysis, Psychoanalysis(Bion, Klain, Winnicott), Psychodelic treatements, holotropic breathing.

Authors:Jung, Winnicott, Perls
