Belonging and shared identity.Tendencty to merge as a whole for a common vision with a leader who maintains the spirit and the coherence of the group.
Risk: To lose contact with others groups, putting group's dynamics over rational ideas (in the shape of a cult).

Description:The Leader has a group approach where they want to find an inspiration that may take them and others to a better place.

Shadow:When we polarise into it we may become too embedded in our group ideals and develop a cult like behaviour, rejecting external opinions.

Traditions:Confesional therapies

Authors:Freud when making seven rings
