Proposes and challenges. The type of therapist who wants to promote change in the client by bringing exercises, homework, and a battery of solutions. They have an answer for everything and a tool for every problem. They are on top of what is happening and will try to help you feel better soon. They tend to be pragmatic, enthusiastic, and encouraging.
Risk: Controlling the situation and not giving space for the client to express all their angles.


Description:The Changer position invite us to encurage change in our clients by directly finding solutions, new behaviours, or exercises.

Shadow:When we polarise into it we may become controlling, not giving enough space for the other to express their deeper feelings.

Traditions:Cognitive Behavioural, Integrative approaches

Authors:Beck, Elis
