# Therapeutic Positions

Caring or therapeutic positions aim to show the complexities of our caring and how we can move and be more open to different ways of work. It also help us to see our prefered positions and therefore style.

This model unpacks some of the most important elements of our psychotherapy landscape. Yes, even more than the components and philosophy.

When I talk with therapists, I feel is this model what comes first to my mind. Most of us identify with one of the main groups of therapy: 
-	Psychodynamic: group that analyses and makes interpretations. It defines a broader spectrum than psychoanalysis. The focus is on hermeneutic interpretation of the relationship and unconscious.
-	Person centred: group that focusses in listening attentively and giving unconditional positive regard (plus other elements). The focus is on phenomenological experience. 
-	CBT: group that follows the scientific tradition, aiming for effectiveness of change through evidence-based interventions. Focus on electiveness of change through exercises and homework.
-	Humanistic: group that trust human experience and experimentation. A known example is Gestalt, but there are many other approaches here. Focus on experimentation in somewhat challenging but playful experiences. 
Even though these four groups are not descriptive of the whole variety of approaches, it is common colleagues use one of these to describe their work, because they are a short hand, and a broad categorisation.
What I came to wonder is if there was something behind these groups. And after trying many ideas I came out with some polarities of our work:
-	We are or more receptive and following or more propositive (we propose things)
-	We are more acceptant of our clients or more challenging
These create four groups of positions:
-	Compassionate: we are receptive of our clients and we follow what they say to promote a space of acceptance of all they are
-	Inquisitive: we wonder and inquire, we think what may be happening behind, and try to find a pattern that makes sense
-	Playful: we propose something to do, an activity that may help the client to see themselves from a different angle, helping them see and accept themselves better
-	Changer: we push for a change, we are committed to take our clients out of where they are and we guide them into a better place. 
These four marks for me positions, I personally move between them, depending on my clients and how I am feeling, but I also have some sort of preferred positions, some way of working that feel more coherent to me. 
These positions mirror the main four groups of psychotherapy, but in a way that does not keep them as rigid groups, but as flexible elements we can deep in and out. They also mark a flavour of who we are as people, and what we feel is more coherent at the moment of helping someone else.
The outer circle is what I propose happens when we get polarised into one of these positions. We risk losing our boundaries when we are too compassionate, or we get too controlling when we are too much into changing our clients. We may get into enactments if we are too playful, or we may be overthinking what we are doing if we are to inquisitive. 
I hope you can see that they work as opposites, and therefore they can help us to balance out, the shortcomings of each other.
