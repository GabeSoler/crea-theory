description: Follows and accepts. Type of therapist that welcomes and holds anything that the client brings. Its words and interventions are soft and give a feeling of wholesomness. They never make you feel uncomfortable, nor challenge any of your comments. They are patient and no mater what you do, always see it in a good light. The Compassionate position make us feel close to other's feelings and suffering, giving lots of space to express other people's experience. In this position we follow the rhytm of the other person avoiging interruptions

shadow: When we polarise into it we may have difficulties with setting boundaries, which means that we tend to put others before ourselves. Lack of boundaries, clients abusing the ‘good’ therapist.

traditions: Person Centred, Focusing, Relational Psychoanalisis.

authors: Rogers, Jung, Stolorow, Orange
