Proposes and accepts. A type of therapist who tries to bring new things to the session to help the client process and move forward. They see many opportunities to help through little exercises like art-making, meditation, and role-playing. The goal is to activate the client's own processes by creating spaces of insight.
Risk: unconscious enactments, opening up things without the right timing.

Description:The Playful position invite us to create activities that can mobilise emotions, so we can process them.

Shadow:When we polarise into it we may have problems with enactments, risking our unconcious to engangle and bring forth primitive dynamics.

Traditions:Gestalt, Psychodrama, Play Therapy, Art therapies.

Authors:Perls, Moreno, Winnicott
