description: Proposes and challenges. The type of therapist who wants to promote change in the client by bringing exercises, homework, and a battery of solutions. They have an answer for everything and a tool for every problem. They are on top of what is happening and will try to help you feel better soon. They tend to be pragmatic, enthusiastic, and encouraging. The Changer position invite us to encurage change in our clients by directly finding solutions, new behaviours, or exercises.

shadow: When we polarise into it we may become controlling, not giving enough space for the other to express their deeper feelings. Controlling the situation and not giving space for the client to express all their angles.

traditions: Cognitive Behavioural, Integrative approaches
