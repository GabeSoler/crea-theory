shadow: When we polarise into it we may have difficulties with stopping our delightful practices, risking addiction and fixation. The thirst for experience can become an addiction.

traditions: Jungian analysis, Psychoanalysis(Bion, Klain, Winnicott), Psychodelic treatements, holotropic breathing.

authors: Jung, Winnicott, Perls
