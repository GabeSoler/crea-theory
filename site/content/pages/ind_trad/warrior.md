Striking and rigorous. Warriors want to keep developing so they can achieve the next stage: to become more powerful and efficient.
Risk: Disconnection from others and their own feelings leads to tunnel vision, where they can only go forward.

Description:The Warrior has a self development approach, aiming to help by becoming stronger, achieving higher concepts and techniques.

Shadow:When we polarise into it we risk to develop a tunel vision towards our fight and projects, not able to see around anymore.

Traditions:Cognitive Behavioural, Gestalt

Authors:Beck, Ellis, Perls, Wilber
