description: Spirit Guardian. Concepts and categories are the path, 'I can understand everything but never feel close to it'. The Sage path invite us to analyse things in their components and to create more encompasing models that help us clarify our minds and the big problems of existence.

shadow: When we polarise into it we may become obsessed with concepts and with the need to categorise every inch of human experience, clauding our mind to the beauty of life. Obsession, losing the magic and ground, the projects takes all meaning.

traditions: Integral approach, Integrative approaches.

authors: Wilber, Kegan
