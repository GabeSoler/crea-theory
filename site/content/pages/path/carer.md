description:  Life Guardian. Connecting with even the smallest thing: “I can care for everything, but never for myself”. The Carer path is an invitation towards closeness to otherness, by an appreciation of life and the movements of nature.

shadow: When we polarise into it we may become too close to care for others forgeting to care for ouselves, we become submisive. Submission, caring but forgetting themselves.

traditions: Person Centred, Focusing, Relational Psychoanalisis.

authors: Rogers, Orange
