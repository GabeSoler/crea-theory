- Values system/worldview (based on Spiral dynamics; Robert Kegan) Having multiple or changes in time is expected and may be a sing of self complexity.
    
    Score each to see the presence of them. People opening the higher ones may feel represented by many of the previous ones. People in the first ones will not feel represented by the higher ones.

# Dependant

Person who needs other people to take all decisions. There is not rulebook to follow (difference with traditional), they need constant input from others as they don't hold rules no self-motives.

# Self centred

This type of person believes in themselves as the centre of its values and goals. All the rest comes in a second level. 

The group is seen as utilitarian, no sense of belonging.


# Traditional

These types of persons puts its group, or the traditions they follow first, and it is the main reference for their decisions. There is a rulebook to follow and this person will fight for it. 

—> expected at trainee level

# Modern

Believe in progress as a constant force, that needs to be achieved by organised institutions.

Focus on individual roles for progress, self achievement and competition. You  constant improvement helps the system.

—> minimum level for practice.


# Anti-modern

Somewhat in parallel with modern, but more a response to it's pathological side.

When modern becomes too rigid into one sphere (religion, science, art, politics) or excludes a group of them, there emerges counter modern groups.

In our case the hippie and new age tried to compensate the strong centre in science and aggressive politics.

They brought religion into a higher development stage than traditional, and opened the creative work for more people. 

The first stages of modern tend to fragment and break into pieces.


# Integrative

These people believe that all cultures should be respected inside complex systems. There is a space for everyone in society, no matter how different we are. 

Creation of mind maps to represent difference.

For me the last stage of modern thinking is the integrative, when the fragments of modern can unite into a meta (conceptual) model.


# Post Modern/compost

These person believe in deconstructing ideas, and trying to find new meanings. Believe that institutions and organisations have a problem and need constant criticism.

Sometimes post modern is positioned after modern, and I put two stages before. When you read actual postmodern authors you realise they are not just post modern but post integral. So, we call post modern to anti modern, confusing both groups.

Most post modern philosophers are able to understand and see the logical mistakes of their predecessors, inside their own frame of reference. Which leads these thinkers to follow the “incompleteness  theorem” of Godel, that not formal system can justify itself, it always needs external systems to make sense.

A new name for them is “compost” refering to the breaking to make growth of nature.

# Interindividual

Person who emphasises deep connection, the need for constant learning and development, rooted in a profound ethics of shared humanity while treasuring difference. 

Proposed by Robert Kegan after modern, it's positioned by Wilber after integrative. This stage requires deep self knowledge and connection with others. It's an immanent abstraction already in the third tier.

It goes beyond cognitive comprehension of difference and is looking for constant self transformation to be coherent with these values.

# Intra-grative

This is my own spin into the integrative discussion

I criticise the idea of cognitive integration, as it feels for me as an extension of modern thinking.

When we see the post modern critique and the inter-individual of kegan, we can see that one can break the systems and embody them more deeply at the same time.

A cognitive integration I call integrative, as extension of modern thinking. Wilber and Opazo fall in this category.

Intra-grative, on the other hand, incorporates the post, the inter individual, and the alchemist transformation proposed by Jung.

The intra comes from Karen Barad’s idea of intra-action. Interaction (the common word) keeps the individuals as individuals, however, intra-action involves them deeply, becoming something new in the process. Intra-gration follows this idea, as you change deeply when engaging with new knowledge and traditions.

This is not a merely intellectual process, but a deeply felt and transformative one.


# Tiers

# First:until anti-modern

The psychic organs develop through stages. Basic access to their planes.

Each stage it's not just a stage but the initiation in a plane. Each plane can then be developed further.

Planes examples:

- Sensorimotor, first years of live initiate the plane of the body functions
- Pre operational, initiates the subtle, dream-like plane
- Concrete operation, initiate the concrete real
- Abstract operations, initiate abstract conceptual

# Second: integrative and postmodern

Solidification of an identity and a place in the collective.

Humans need to craft their identity in a process of creation/discovery.

Even thought the true self is there from the beginning, each stage before initiated a plane and the self needs to finds its way in each.

It is at this tier when we can make sense of all the path and the multiple selves we have inhabited.

A new sense of I am, as part of the world, in a changing deepening.


# Third: inter-individual and intra-grative

Here we can take this crafted self and share it with others at inter-individual.

As we open up and explore we realise we can create even further who we are, specialising, finding more singularities.

As we understand development itself inside ourselves we can take our skills and profession to exponential new levels. We can correct problems of the past and fine tune our talents.

Intra-grative allow us to consciously activate, mix, and borrow from others, new patterns of our self. We can integrate our shadow, developing also our week areas and opposite personalities.
