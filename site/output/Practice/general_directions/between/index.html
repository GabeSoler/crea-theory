<h1 id="spaces-between">spaces between</h1>
<p>Therapy happens in a between place. It is between in so many ways. On one hand between therapist and client somethieng emerges, something unique and that can only be seen moment to moment.</p>
<p>We inhabit a relational space, where we are individuals and at the same time our boundaries of individuality lower and we can connect at a deeper level.</p>
<p>This level means that our unconcious processes entangle, and my conflicts can pass to you as well as my wisdom.</p>
<h2 id="more-than-relational">more than relational</h2>
<p>The space between also encompases the objects around, the context, time keeping, the office, etc. This falls into the space of objects and transitional objects.</p>
<p>In development we see that objects emerge by differentiation, when our identity can step out and eject something from our mind. Before that objects are invisible, and we cannot relate with them and use them properly.</p>
<p>objectum, has to do with an ejection.</p>
<p>Transitional objects are quite magical, in the sanse that they are hald ejected. They remain close to us, belinging to the inner world and the external world at the same time.</p>
<p>Ejamples are the blaket of the baby, its favourit felt animal, and toys. THose objects are more than what they are, as the unconcious bond allows them to fill spaces in the unconcious, as the child can be creative and explorative in a fantasy/reality space.</p>
<h2 id="good-enough-mother">good enough mother</h2>
<p>But this is only a part of the picture. A baby needs more than cuddles and connection with their mom.</p>
<p>Winnicott's practice makes paralells with the 'good enough mother'. By observing mothers he proposes three main functions for healthy development : holding, handling and object presentation.</p>
<p>Holding encompasses empathy and emotional tunning. Sometimes actual holding, touch, using a blanket. It is more about feeling held than being held, but a good holding when we cannot move on our own is fundamental to feel safe as we grow.</p>
<p>Handling enconpasess limits, time, payment, active regulations, exercises. Handling is all the mother does to manage a baby, changin nappies, having food, clieaning, protecting the corners, etc. Handling goes not concious for the baby at the begning, but Winnicott asks mothers to slowly show their work, so babies can get a better perspective.</p>
<p>Object presentation has to do with showing the world, giving things for the baby to explore and play with. Concrete objects, ideas and models, exercises, fall in this category.</p>
<p>Object presentation needs also to be part of our therapy, as we how the world a new, we give new options, we change scheems, or open and close gestalts.</p>
<h2 id="the-true-self">the true self</h2>
<p>But there is here another mayor component: the true self of client and therapist. For me this is the main Winnicottian contribution, and it is sometimes hard to grasp in its complexity and simplicity.</p>
<p>As therapist many times we forget that we have unique needs and unique creative impulses. We forget that moment to moment we need to create and discover the world. That if we do not feel creative, and participant on the world's creation, we start feeling fake, empty, meaningless.</p>
<p>For this self to emerge, Winnicott proposes babies first need full adaptation with a slow reveal of the self of the other.</p>
<p>In client work some clients may need that slow appearance of the therapist as a person. Small comments about my life, small moments of hesitation, silences, improvisations, are telling my client: Gabriel is someone else.</p>
<p>Sadly we sometimes not appear, and that communicates: &ldquo;being yourself is not that important&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When we appear slowly and carefully we communicate "being yourself it is important, but it can be done with care and consideration".</p>
<p>I consider myself one of the therapist who got into it because I did not have a strong boundary setting, because being submissive was easy to me, and was able to pospone my needs for a long time.</p>
<p>It has taken me years of work in myself to discover the importance of being myself, and showing who i am in session.</p>
<p>Being in a please and appease mode helps with the holding, maybe with the handling, but it failis with the object presentation.</p>
