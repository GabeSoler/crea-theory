<h1 id="opposite-therapist-style">Opposite therapist style</h1>
<p>It's the contrary therapeutic position, ie. Playful Vs inquisitive, or compassionate Vs changer.</p>
<p>You need to integrate your opposite in a 80/20 relationship to be balanced, in the sense of keeping your main style while being able to access others in a smaller proportion when needed.</p>
<p>Also the paths have opposites: dreamer Vs explorer, carer Vs sage</p>
<h1 id="opposite-sexuality">Opposite sexuality</h1>
<p>The integration of anima/animus includes an integration of your opposite sexuality and gender. And 80/20 is enough to be balanced, integrating your shadow and keeping your main identity.</p>
<h1 id="opposite-elements">Opposite elements</h1>
<p>Following Jung's personality system, that for me is also part of this profiling, we have elements</p>
<p>Fire: intuition</p>
<p>Air: reason</p>
<p>Water: emotion</p>
<p>Earth: sensations</p>
<p>Opposites are fire Vs Earth; water vs air or intuition and sensations, reason and emotion.</p>
<p>We usually have two dominant and the contraires are our shadow.</p>
<p>This can express introverted or extroverted. Air as vocal or as thoutful thinker. Fire as artist in parties and concerts, or as imaginative writer.</p>
