<h1 id="fawn-responses">Fawn responses</h1>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Common in therapists</p>
<p>Difficult to work around as helps to make client feel comfortable and safe</p>
<p>But it's not really efficient, leaves client feeling a bit confused</p>
<p>Subtle work to heal: involves early trauma, place in the family and a learned position where your true self is not important, focusing on the other in detriment of you.</p>
<p>Many therapist feel they will be good at it because they are good at the fawn response. Pervasive in the profession, specially counselling side.</p>
