<ul>
<li><p>A four axis path</p>
<p>This image bellow represents the idea that we can go towards stress states to the left and meditative states to the right.</p>
<p>The horizontal movement is the becoming path, embracing multiplicity.</p>
<p>From bottom to top we grow in abstraction, steps of morals and understanding. This is the development path.</p>
<p>Therapists usually master the stress states while monks and shamans the meditative ones.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside these axis one can specialise and manage more one area.</p>
<p>There could be many ways inside these map, many specialisations. Warriors also master their stress responses to be able to fight. Explorers may move between, shamanes too.</p>
<p><aside>
ðŸ’¡ As explored in my thesis, professions carry a transitional function. They are *between* at their core, even thought they can get perverted by abuse and external control. At the core of each profession there is a point of assemblage between intensive and extensive and a transitional plane of &ldquo;object use&rdquo;, of technique that carries the intentions of the person and the archetypical force of the tradition. Every progression*/profession* can be transitional and benefit from these reflections(here applied to psychotherapy)</aside></p>
