<ul>
<li><p>Transitional (non) approach</p>
<p>After seeing the full stack of therapy, the question is how to proceed. My answer is to focus on the person of the therapist and allow development to take course. This course is aided by a good menu of options that are not competing.</p>
<p>Instead of offering truth to swallow create an environment where new therapist can develop their own truths. Using developmental research we  clean the path for it to thrive.</p>
