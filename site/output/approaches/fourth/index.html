<li><p>In-between</p>
<p>This group starts diluting many categories and making new logical structure, many incorporate the cybernetic logic but with new spins. There is a new phenomenology that includes body, movement and relationship.</p>
<p>Varela is crucial in many of this, as creator of autopoiesis and  neurophenomenology.</p>
<p>Developmental approaches also emerge as a form of analysis, crossing through traditions. The human as process in stages, reality in nested structures is a distinct new approach.</p>
<p>Each new component is different than previous once,</p>
<p>Participatory incorporated all this new elements in a coherent new approach, but I thought it was better to show the new components</p>

<li><p>Phenomenology -third Gen</p>
<p>Phenomenology of Husserl was trying to be objective inside subjectivity. It also was disembodied. Merlou Ponty changed this, incorporating new depths to phenomenology.</p>
<p>After that turn, we see further incorporation of elements, with enactments and relationship.</p>

<p>Their work is so unique that cannot be fully pinpointed</p>
<p>Mixing cybernetics with Lacan, moving from biology go machines, to social madness.</p>

<p>In general, use of abstract meta theorisation to organise knowledge. I differentiate because of the abstract quality of it, and the rigidity of those categories.</p>

<li><p>Integration(comment)</p>
<p>When we do integration it can be at any level of the therapy stack. We can integrate at the components level and it's technique, at a approach level, at a tradition level.</p>
<p>Opazo integration is mostly at the components/technique level, with it's own approach level.</p>
<p>Wilber integration is at the approach level, with a meta approach.</p>
<p>Participatory approach is an in-between approach, and therefore somehow integrative.</p>
<p>There is integration at tradition level, teaching person centre, psychodynamic and CBT, without clarifying the other levels (not coherent).</p>
<p>Jung's integration happens at the person level, addressing the person of the therapist, what I call intra-grative, or alchemical integration.</p>
