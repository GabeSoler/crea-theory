<h2 id="participatory-ontology-and-the-current-academic-divide">Participatory ontology and the current academic divide</h2>
<p>Currently academia is divided in two big ays of seeing the world sciences and humanities.</p>
<p>The roots of this divide is old and has roots in the separation of the positivistic and constructivist approaches. Which is also based in the even older objective versus subjective divide.</p>
<p>If we go back to Greece, Plato believed in the ideas and Aristotle in the observation.</p>
<p>So we have a problem old as abstract thinking goes.</p>
<p>Positivism says we can measure an stable world and constructivsm that we create realities. We have moderated views of this, but nothing works as a coherent project of research like the participatory paradigm proposed by Haron and Reason.</p>
<p>For my surprise they quoted as examples the author's I liked the most, so they got me immediately with their ideas.</p>
<p>I see this project as an assemblage ontology. There is a reality we assemble with. As we develop that reality changes and we can be more precise. So there is a objective realty that is always in change, depending on our assemblage with it.</p>
<p>It is participatory because we alter reality with our actions, perceptions, involvement. We never get a full objectivity as we change things when we measure. We need multiple observation and triangulation.</p>
<p>Psychological, relational realities are also part of rigourous research and can be studied with an understanding of the observer. Varela is a good example here when he does neurophenomenology. He considered a relational, embodied and enactive subject and used neuroimaging to correlate knowledge.</p>
<p>Kegan is another example, studying the structure of development by telling stories, using research and proposing a moving reality we can be rigourous to research.</p>
