<h3 id="nor-this-nor-that-or-why-it-depends">Nor this nor that or why &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;</h3>
<p>A nor this nor that position is not always easy to understand or handle.</p>
<p>For me it comes from a simple truth of living systems, we need a right amount of things, we need just enough.</p>
<p>How much is too hot at home? Probably above 23 degrees Celsius. How much is too cold? Probably bellow 18. Do hot or cold are the right answer?</p>
<p>I say nor this nor that.</p>
<p>Just enough, somewhere between. And&hellip; it depends on the person, the clothes, etc.</p>
<p>That's why a good therapist always says &ldquo;it depends&rdquo;</p>
