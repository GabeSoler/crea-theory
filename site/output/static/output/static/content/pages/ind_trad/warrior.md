description: Striking and rigorous. Warriors want to keep developing so they can achieve the next stage, to become more powerful and efficient. The Warrior has a self development approach, aiming to help by becoming stronger, achieving higher concepts and techniques.

shadow: When we polarise into it we risk to develop a tunel vision towards our fight and projects, not able to see around anymore. Disconnection from others and their own feelings leads to tunnel vision, where they can only go forward.

authors: Beck, Ellis, Perls, Wilber
