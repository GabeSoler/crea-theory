description: Follows and challenges.This type of therapist follows the client's process silently and awaits the right moment to comment or say a few words. They work by finding details in what the client brings that may trigger internal processes. They are subtle and make you feel they know something you have yet to figure out. The Inquisitive position invite us to analyse and collect information to find clues of deeper conflicts and underlying dynamics.

shadow: When we polarise into it we may find ourselves over-thinking and detached from the present emotional dynamic.

traditions: Traditional Psychoanalysis, Lacanian psychoanalysis, Jungian analysis.

authors: Freud, Klein, Bion, Kernberg
