description: The world can be studied by trials and statistics. An impartial observer tries to clean itself from distortions and emotions to reach a pure access to reality. We need to focus on what can be predictable and controllable, and leave behind knowledge that does not fit with this assumptions. It encompasses positivism and post-positivism. 

example: Research with statistics about efficiency in psychotherapy, using neuroimaging and psychobiology. 

traditions: Evidence Based, CBT
