description: The world is made of processes and patterns, that we can model and intervene. There is not need for deep abstractions or associations when we can see what is actually happening and describe it formally. Computers are a type of system, and families are another. We can use similar methods, and see the world as information. G Bateson was one of the first ones to use these methods in a psychological research. 

example: A systemic therapist describes the communicational patterns of a family, and discovers that the father raises the voice every time one of the children speaks. The therapist interrupts this pattern the next time it happens. 

traditions: Systemic Therapy, Pragmatic Therapy.
