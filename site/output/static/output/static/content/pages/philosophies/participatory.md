description: We are part of what we study and we need to own it. Reality is unique for each, but at the same time there is a common reality we are all accessing in our participation with it. Our methods cannot separate action and knowledge. 

example: Using enactments in session in a disciplined way, means to accept we are part of the process and we need to be careful and ready to repair. 

traditions: Relational Psychoanalysis, Intersubjective Psychoanalysis, Psychodrama, Drama Therapy.
