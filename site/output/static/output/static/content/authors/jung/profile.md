I imagine Jung as a Inquisitive therapist, who allowed space to his clients to express and guide the sessions, an he would offer his comments and interpretations. He is probably more into acceptance than Freud, and a bit more propositive as well, but they would share this results. Jung appears as a Dreamer, as he is focussed on the intensive spaces, and not so much into making things clear, but staying in the metaphors and holding space of a process. He is also an artist in the tradition point, as he always focused on finding his true self more than anything else. 

Regarding components he has a much more marked emphasis in the cultural space, and the extended awareness than Freud. Jung participated with many philosophers and academics that where studying anthropology and compared religions. He also put an emphasis into the spiritual and explored many ways of accessing altered states of conciseness. He proposed an individuation process as the core of his therapy, and is his higher score. 

Philosophically he is also an hermeneutic, but had a strong spiritual worldview that guided him. He made this more explicit in his work published after death. He also had some hints of participatory, as he saw the perceptions of the world as changing with our own changes.
