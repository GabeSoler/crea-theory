I imagine Freud as a therapist that has a core of Inquisitive as style, always looking for the secrets behind, but not showing his cards too quickly, and not offering solutions or actions. He challenges people and also society with his style, at the same time that follows the client in their process.

I see him as a Sage, as he tries to construct a clear model, fighting to find the truth. He is more in the intensive world than the concrete one, and likes to divide and conquer, more than contain others or complex ideas. 

His relationship with the tradition is complicated, and here I put him as a Warrior, as he is trying to find his own path and techniques. However, later he will become a Leader and Coach, depending on the moment of his life.

In the components we can see how he worked with dreams, with sex and gender, and subliminal spaces. He also was connected with the arts and had a concern for the relationship in therapy with the notion of transference.

Philosophically, he was mainly an hermeneutic thinker, exploring the meanings behind, with a side on phenomenology, as he explored lived experience, and for quite a while he tried to be scientific in his logics, to relax about it over time.
