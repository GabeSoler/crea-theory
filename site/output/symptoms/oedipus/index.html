<p>The Oedipus relational step it's crucial in personality development. It creates a stop in the unending drive, allowing the person to self regulate and to have ethical reflection.</p>
<p>It needs to happen inside an intense relationship, parent-child or couple, sometimes in deep therapy, when allowing transference and working it well.</p>
<p>The only healthy form is to pause someone in a perverse state. Perverse states are looking for a climax through exiting engagement.</p>
<p>In couples break up this is re-opened, with the potential of a regression. Couples combine adult and child entanglements and if we only end as &ldquo;adults&rdquo; there is a child-self that may stay hurt.</p>
<p>Pause: you say this is not the moment but you are not wrong. Preserved the connection, and separates due the nature of a complex world. &ldquo;I love you but this does not work in this world&rdquo; keeps the heart connection and establishes a sense of reality simultaneously.</p>
<p>For couples it's &ldquo;I have loved you, and you are part of my life, I will remember you(not suppress), but it's time to walk apart&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The non healthy options (from better to worse) are:</p>
<p>Cutting: splitting without emotion. Clear cut forgetting any human emotional bond. CC is clear and could understand if development is ok. There remains a bitter pain in the heart, UCC feels something is still open.</p>
<p>Breaking: more aggressive, break with anger. UCC is clear but in pain. Cc may be angry and no close.</p>
<p>Detaching: indifference, ghosting. Leaves UCC confused. There is no closure, cc keeps wondering. May damage sense of worth as you are dismissed as a feeling-human.</p>
