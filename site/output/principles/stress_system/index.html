<p>My definition of health is &ldquo;a system without distress&rdquo; (and it apply to all systems).</p>
<p>Stress has two sides: distress, when it damages the system, and eustress when helps the system to adapt and solve problems.</p>
<p>Humans work stress with the sympathetic and parasympathetic. The main hormones are cortisol and adrenaline at the sympathetic side.</p>
<p>When cortisol is low it is useful, when states for long it start damaging organs and the system in general.</p>
<p>The parasympathetic keep us relaxed but also leads to freeze. The sympathetic activate and also leads to fight/flight.</p>
<p>The notion of window of tolerance is crucial, a balance of both systems creates a between state of relaxed activation, playfulness, curiosity, creativity.</p>
<p>The extremes can alter any personality, mental state, knowledge. It damages de system at a physical and mental level. And creates symptoms we have called &ldquo;mental health disorders&rdquo; and &ldquo;autoimmune decease&rdquo;.</p>
