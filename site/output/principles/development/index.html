<p>Something that confuses us often is to see people at different levels of development, enlightenment and disorganisation.</p>
<p>We have the possibility to move between stages of development, have parts at different levels, or even skills or traits.</p>
<p>On the other hand we can disorganised even if our core is at a high level, and we may carry that level in our conflicts (like being rational but desperate and a bit loosing it).</p>
<p>We can also be enlightened and have a low level of development or have parts at those low levels. We can also move towards disorganized states due trauma or life conflicts.</p>

<p>To help with all this options made this graphic, showing all the movements in different directions.</p>
<p>Structures like borderline is usually placed in dependant and self centred stages, but we can find people at higher development and being fragmented.</p>
