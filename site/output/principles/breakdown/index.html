<h3 id="fear-of-breakdown-enactments">Fear of breakdown: enactments</h3>
<p>The fear comes from an experience that happened but it's not in memory.</p>
<p>Things that happen early in life may not be registered on our normal memory systems. Also some extreme experiences, may be not registered in memory for their traumatic implications.</p>
<p>So we can fear something we don't have a symbolic representation for.</p>
<p>Winnicott said it's better to create the conditions for a healthy breakdown, so it can be in memory and addressed, avoiding a life lived in fear.</p>
<p>This relates with the &ldquo;enactment&rdquo; in therapy. It's the idea that we need to repeat to remember to elaborate. Some things need to come into actions for our minds to have a chance to deal with them.</p>
<p>Therapist who use enactment need to be really aware of them and know how to manage processes as they evolve inside the relationship. Usually a therapist finds themself in the middle of an enactment, where they are playing a traumatising role for the client. Being able to recognise and repair is the only healthy way through.</p>
<p>I see this as unconscious entanglement, where our conflicts somehow sync and we find ourselves playing a part we could not even imagine.</p>
<p>The only way to understand this is to be in the middle&hellip;so don't beat yourself&hellip;</p>
<p>It was Ferenczi who first recognised this pattern (&rdquo;confusion of tongues&rdquo;). But Freud had already written a paper called &ldquo;repeat, remember, and working through&rdquo;.</p>
