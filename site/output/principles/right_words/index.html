<h3 id="finding-the-right-words">Finding the right words</h3>
<p>From many traditions naming things is important.</p>
<p>Freud proposed we split our affects and memories from their symbolic or verbal correlates to handle them better.</p>
<p>Matching the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; with their word would open up the defense.</p>
<p>Gendin proposes we have a &ldquo;felt sense&rdquo;, a surrounding affect that is there implicitly, but we can make it explicit.</p>
<p>When the felt sense finds a good container, words or another form it seems to move on, creating a process.</p>
<p>In gestalt therapy, when we manage to close something open it also moves on. Sometimes naming help us to close, sometimes the words of another or an action.</p>
<p>As therapist sometimes we mirror our clients. Human mirroring consist of saying what we see. That helps the other to gain perspective, sometimes new worlds or models of what is there but implicit.</p>
<p>Finding the right words helps, as we are quite verbal, but it's not the only container. It's a good one because help us to gain coherence and narrative.</p>
<p>But words can mirror in different ways. As Jung said of symbols, they can be represented in infinite ways. And in different levels of abstraction.</p>
<p>So&hellip; what's the right word?</p>
<p>The one that makes the felt sense move on, the one that closes the gestalt, the one that opens the defense&hellip;.</p>
<p>And then may be more right words&hellip;</p>
