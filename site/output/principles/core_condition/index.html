<h3 id="the-one-core-condition">The one core condition</h3>
<p>Rogers proposed the core conditions for therapy, and I agree with them, but they are understood quite differently by different people.</p>
<p>I have heard so many times trainees saying &ldquo;Shit I cannot do well the unconditional positive regard&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Or feeling puzzled by &ldquo;if I am coherent I would be saying shit in the session&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For me the one core condition is</p>
<ul>
<li>to keep a psychological contact.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do I mean with that?</p>
<p>To feel how the me and you are playing, how they make a we, and us, and also two individuals.</p>
<p>Notice when that breaks and see a way to come back to it.</p>
<p>Contact is not push and pull, it's soft touch.</p>
<p>And then be playful, but aware.</p>
<p>The rest comes with practice and self development.</p>
