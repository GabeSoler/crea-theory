<h3 id="a-theory-for-everything-bio-logic">A theory for everything: bio-logic</h3>
<p>There is a simple model that helps me to understand multiple phenomenon, from mind, to biology, groups, sociology, ecology, economics.</p>
<p>It's simple, and for the same reason useful.</p>
<ul>
<li>First there is creative chaos from where some functional element emerge</li>
<li>Then those come together and create a border, defining an identity</li>
<li>The identity assembles to a territory of safety, feeding, playing, learning and relating.</li>
<li>Then there are others doing the same, and we create synergy.</li>
<li>Synergy creates meta organisations and new emergencies.</li>
<li>Each identity has a few tendencies:</li>
<li>Homeostasis and feedback to keep balance.</li>
<li>Feedforward, line of flight, we move to avoid problems or to get rewarded.</li>
<li>Growth: new tendencies emerge from inside the system, making it more complex.</li>
<li>Growth creates instability and may be mistaken with an external attack, losing the chance of reaching a higher order balance.</li>
<li>Feedforward towards growth, it's a period of fast learning and change to reach a new homeostasis, it's important to find balance again for the identity to not shatter.</li>
</ul>
